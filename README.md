# DataSet_Augmentation-
this git contains the applied dataSet augmentation in the context of bridging the gap between the simulation and the real world for autonomous vehicles 
the augment_Perturbationdrive uses already implemented functions to perturbate images(before running make sure to update the paths for output images and conversion to the right format for the model training)
the augmentDEF helps test the limit of the simulator (to use later)
